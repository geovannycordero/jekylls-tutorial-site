Jekylls tutorial. From the official page.

Jekyll is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look like, what data gets displayed on the site, and more.

# Setup

- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
